### About Me
Hey there! I'm Joey Laya (they/them).  Iâ€™m passionate about catalyzing social liberation at the intersections of creative expression, cultural connection, and technological innovation.

I am eager to learn, collaborate, and work alongside a team dedicated to creating and cultivating projects that genuinely make a difference in the lives of others.

When I'm not designing or coding, I'm making music, spending time with my spouse and four cats, or watching reality TV on Netflix.
