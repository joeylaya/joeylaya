### About Me
Hey there 👋🏽 I'm Joey Laya (they). I'm a bootcamp-graduated and self-taught software engineer engaging in technically and socially innovative work.

In pursuing software engineering, I've discovered how my technical and formulaic thinking, creative mindset, and social justice underpinnings compound into an exciting and essential niche in my life and the world around me. I'm passionate about leveraging tech and artistry in **human-centric** and **boldly radical** ways that further **social liberation**. 

Currently, I am looking to collaborate, grow, and contribute alongside a team dedicated to creating and cultivating projects that genuinely make a difference in the lives of others. I'm especially interested in projects related to Web3, decentralization, open-source development, social justice, climate justice, music, and education.
