### About Me
Hey there 👋🏽 I'm Joey (they) -- software engineer, creator, and anarchist. I began seriously exploring software engineering at the end of 2021, but I've been designing, building, programming, solving, and imagining my whole life. Coding simply put a name to the way my mind has always worked.

I'm passionate about leveraging tech in **human-centric** and **boldy radical** ways that further **social liberation**. I'm especially interested in collaborating on technially and socially innovative projects related to Web3, decentralization, open source development, social justice, climate justice, and education.
